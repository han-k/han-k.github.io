basic first file
this is for the generation of a xmas card (instead of a gingerbread house!)

so far - i've generated a new branch on my github pages repo and copied the jekyll blog over (jeyll-backup) and created a new branch call card.
i think went into the desktop client, opened the card brnach, deleted all files, committed, pushed, and it's showing as now this is clear.
next step is to make a generic index.html file as my base, merge to the master (since master is the only branch that will push to the website), which should drop the jekyll blog (which again was backed up already), and set the stage for a clean start.
