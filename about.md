### More Information

This isn't necessarily only about coding or techonology, but learning & developing my skills in those topics is absolutely part of the goal. 
That said, I have no shortage of personal goals, including regarding better time management, organization & productivity, eating better, and being overall more intentional and behaving more in line with values I have - even if the actions I take don't always align with them. 

**_This is about establishing that alignment._**

The one-liner at the top of the page is the mindset I'm trying to establish in these early days. I find that I feel best when I am productive and I takes steps towards my goals. That doesn't mean I love the fact of establishing that self-discipline, but I definitely appreicate the feelings that follow at the end of a day of good action. Filling my days with good, intentional action is the best way I can readily identify at this moment that leads unquestionably towards overall improvement.
