didn't get on the learning laptop until late afternoon; created a slightly tired, frustrated work environment. 
literally the most imporant thing i learned was on the bandit wargames netsec thing: and it was how to properly copy/paste from the terminal. i was beating my head agains the wall trying to figure out how to get from level0 to level1.
did some applied visual design classes in fCC. 
calling it early; tomorrow will be a rainy day, and i'm hoping to have some extra time to play around.
