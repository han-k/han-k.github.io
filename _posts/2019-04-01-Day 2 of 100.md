### just what did i accomplish today?
  - continued fCC - working on CSS. this is still relatively familiar. while i never regularly used CSS in any deployed website [that i would have built 20 years ago], i have "studied" it 3-5 times over the last 5 years in various teach-yourself-coding contexts. i expect to continue being slightly bored for the next few sessions before i move into new items.
  - reconfigured the blog. these posts are daily updates; moved the longer description that was in yesterday's intro post into the about-me section.
  - good workday overall. got a lot done for the ol' employer.
  - good day on the larger projects at hand - that is, the estates i'm administering. communicated with the attorney and made good next steps.
  - good walk with the dog.

### where did i fail today?
 - ate like shit
 - need to better clean office, organize it. 
 - still fighting a feeling of general overwhelm as it pertains to the estates and the physical crap they generate and the tasks they create.
 - not getting good motivation for the fCC. need to explore better ways at keeping the 100 days going - maybe starting/using other pre-bootcamp-esque sites. i found a few interesting books on the topic that could be worth exploring.
