- continued fCC - working on CSS. this is still relatively old hat. while i never regularly used CSS in any deployed website [that i would have built 20 years ago], i have "studied" it 3-5 times over the last 5 years in various teach-yourself-coding contexts. i expect to continue being slightly bored for the next few sessions before i move into new items.
