did several more Bandit levels - getting stuck consistently and using a walkthrough to keep things going, but i might go back and start over just to re-learn stuff along the way.
did several classes of applied visual design on fCC.
only study time today was about an 30min between the two, but it's been a looooong work week, and it's Friday.
(diet's been medium-shit. haven't gotten as many workouts in as i would've liked.)
