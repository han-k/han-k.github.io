good workout this morning. 
got back after breakfast, and did: all the levels in the bandit wargame over, up to 13 - so i advanced 2 levels, but recalled how to do most from memory. i'll keep doing this to generate the memory on how shit works. i cannot fully understand how to READ the goddamn help pages, but hey - getting somewhere.
did more visual design in fCC to keep that moving forward. 

total time spent: ~ 1 hour.
