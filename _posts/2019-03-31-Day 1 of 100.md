### just what did i accomplish today?
  - set up this Jekyll blog, which took substantially longer than I would like. (it also led to decent project ideas for me in the future - like moving a blog to it's own storage, and figuring out how to write the post on my own "computer" instead of in GitHub & pushing (is that the word?) the update to the site from the command line.)
  - cracked into the very-basic basics of writing in markdown
  - completed the basic HTML section of the freeCodeCamp
  - had an intentional breakfast of chicken breast, eggs, and fresh fruit, lunch of steak & arugula 
  - drafted a seperate essay (which may or may not get published in the future) outlining these goals to at least myself
  - basic household tasks: laundry, cleaning kitchen, dishes, etc.
  - critical so far: NO mindless wasteful activities a la numbing, time sucking & battery draining iPhone games
  - long puppy walk (this wasn't a HIKE, but it was 2 miles of good walking with plenty of time for Pip to enjoy her sniffs)

### where did i fail today?
 - did a shitty job keeping my emotions in check; reacted far too much.
 - ate too much for dinner - sushi and appetizer and pad thai = too much.
