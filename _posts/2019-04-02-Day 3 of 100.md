completed a bit better than 1/3 of the fCC CSS instruction. 
this is at least better than expected. 

i feel constricted & confined in my office; i do a lot of my writing in the main area of my home, and i've been trying to learn coding in my office on my desktop (gaming) computer. it's been stifling, since i work in my office all day anyway.
that has led me to learning to install linux mint on an old lenovo laptop. will try to interface with git from there and start to use the terminal. 
and, if nothing else, it's another prong of education i can advance to keep up the 100 days of tech, rather then just going through rote coding guidance on freeCodeCamp (which has been totally fine so far).

also finding some books to read will help. picked up the coder Humble Bundle.
